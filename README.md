analyzing whether the states implementation of gin carry carry law affects the violence rate.

Gun laws are a cause for great discussions in this country. This paper focuses on the laws that enable/restrict an individual to carry guns and its simultaneous effects on the crime rates. Permitting the right to carry concealed handguns has many disparate views, with proponents of the law stating that it would be of critical help to people to enable them to defend themselves against outside threat. The critics of this law, though believe that, legalizing this would lead to increased violence for trivial incidents and the possibility of accidental shootings.

In the following study, we direct our attention towards the effects of the shall issue laws in the 51 states in America over 23 years. Various statistical models are run in an effort to study the trends in crime rates before and after the shall issue laws have been introduced. We also study the effects of factors like income, incarceration, population etc.
